# CNN
My first attempt at computer vision through a Neural Network

First Run Create_Model with a path to your data set
Pass the path to your dataset in load_human_data_set(), this function is being called in the main function
Once the model is created use checkImage to test
This cnn is designed to two classes Human and Non Human.
Sorry I couldnt upload the dataset or joblib file which stored the model(Too large)
